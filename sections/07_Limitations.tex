Discuss limitations and what we could eventually do or integrate in the next few months:
- Our diversity is based on the state visitation and is very naive, so it could be improved


TODO:
- Show the effect of stochasticity in learning the steering policy: varying steps with fixed eta, fixed steps and varying eta.
- Consider other clustering techniques to find the structure of Z and learn a discriminator of them. Is it better than skill discovery?
- Estimate mutual information directly from the noise.
- Integrate flow-based policies
- Integrate and investigate off-policy algorithms such as Soft-diffusion Actor Critic
- Explore different skill discovery objectives
- Learn eta in DDIM to better control the stochasticity of the model
